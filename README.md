# Volatile Hexa

A semi-generative pattern study as a collaborative project between an architect, a coder and a sound designer. 
We simply wired the project to the floor with a Piezo electric device so as the viewer walks close by the installation the whole pattern (visual and sound) reacts to the movement around. The more gentle the viewers move, the more ear pleasing sounds are to be generated. 
The project contains a simple message: we wanted you to gaze into the patterns you find in your daily life as they all have been purposefully designed.

the video is a demonstration of the first phase.

In the following phases I added some glitch effects ,that can be seen in the images, as the reaction to the movements and the way the harmonic Islamic patterns get disturbed and lead to the modern patterns.
